# FoodNoFood
 
The dataset comes from the open dataset available [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000157/versions/00001) collected by [Smeets et al.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23578759)

## Task design

We have 24 seconds blocks of food images (8 blocks) and non-food images (8 blocks) with 8-16 seconds rest blocks showing a crosshair (12 seconds on average). Ten seconds of break are presented in the middle of the task. The repetition time equals 1600 ms, echo time equals 23 ms. 370 scans were made in 10 minutes approximately.
